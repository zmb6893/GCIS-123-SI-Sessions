# Define a function called "ask"

# Prompt a user to answer a question and store the answer in a variable named answer

# Print the answer to the terminal

# Make a function called "data_types"

# What are the different data types and when do you use them?

# Cast these variables to strings and print them to the terminal

# Call your function

# Is there a better way to call your function?
