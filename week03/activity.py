# Import the library for turtle

# Initialize a few global variables for a default color, location, turtle size, and pen size

# Make a function called draw_turtle

# Add three parameters to this function; start_location, color, turtle_size and pen_size

# For now, return nothing

# Make a test in a test_activity.py file

# Make several different test cases to make sure out code work in the end

# Implement your draw_turtle

# Let's add clouds, grass, and rocks to build our turtle habitat. Do this by importing habitat_builder.py

# Draw a turtle
